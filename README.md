|| Fluid Property Package ||

Chemical engineers are determined to find a solution for exciting problems, and a unique physical property package that can predict fluid behavior and best fit properties. Almost all process engineering projects start with simulation to determine fluid physical properties. It is possible that various methods are available and selection of the best model is difficult. In this context, proper basis and assumptions are frequently part of the design and engineering phase activities.

It is a common practice to rely upon data that are validated or verified or compared with experimental data which help to justify theoretical work. e.g. narrow boiling HCs, even a 5% error in VLE matters

Single-phase properties estimation is easier compared to multi-component (phase equilibrium VLE, VLLE) properties estimation. The later is difficult to calculate using a common thermodynamic fluid package with the same accuracy for various properties.

Due to more powerful EoSs are available in today's trend for low, moderate, and high pressures, which describes phase envelope calculation, including the near-critical region (which can describe critical point). Further, excess Gibbs energy type of mixing rules and EoS has narrowed down limitations for an appropriate mixing rule for a homogeneous approach. 

The heterogeneous approach, considered more suitable for non-ideal mixtures, is in principle limited to low-pressure applications and poses difficulty when components behave supercritical at higher pressure.

The fluid package selection scope is not limited to the above description. Users can refer to various literature and publications to gain in-depth knowledge of this subject.

This program is developed based on the Reference Publication: Eric Carlson, Don't gamble with physical properties for simulations, Chem. Eng. Prog. October 1996, 35-46; Thank you to the Publication and Author!

However, a detailed analysis is to be performed based on fluid components and their characteristics. This application will serve as a stand-alone guide that will help the chemical engineering community and Process Simulation stakeholders to start their journey.

This application is beta version 1.0 - MM/YYYY: 06/2022, and is in continuous revision based on a literature study and recent development.
