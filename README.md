Chemical engineers are determined to find a solution for exciting problems, and unique physical property package which can predict fluid behavior and best fit properties. Almost all process engineering projects starts with simulation to determine fluid physical properties. It is possible that various methods are available and selection of the best model is difficult. In this context, proper basis and assumptions are frequently part of the design and engineering phase activities.

It is a common practice to rely upon data those are validated or verified or compared with experimental data which help to justify theoretical work. e.g. narrow boiling HCs, even 5% error in VLE matters

Single-phase properties estimation is easier compared to multi-component (phase equilibrium VLE, VLLE) properties estimation. The later is difficult to calculate using a common thermodynamic fluid package with the same accuracy for various properties.

Due to more powerful EoSs are available in today's trend for low, moderate, and high pressures, which describes phase envelope calculation, including the near-critical region (which can describe critical point). Further, excess Gibbs energy type of mixing rules and EoS has narrowed down limitations for an appropriate mixing rule for a homogeneous approach. 

The heterogeneous approach, considered more suitable for non-ideal mixtures, is in principle limited to low-pressure applications and poses difficulty when components behave supercritical at higher pressure.

The fluid package selection scope is not limited to the above description. Users can refer to various literature and publications to gain in-depth knowledge of this subject.

This application developed based on Reference Publication: Eric Carlson, Don't gamble with physical properties for simulations, Chem. Eng. Prog. October 1996, 35-46 

Various public domain and information available on web is collected and compiled for quick reference purpose only.
However, detail analysis to be performed based on fluid component and it's characteristics. This application will serve as stand-alone guide which will help chemical engineering community and Process Simulation stakeholders to start their journey.
